This repository houses survey data and Python scripts related to a case study performed as part of UMass Dartmouth's CIS352 Empirical Methods course. The purpose of the case study was to gauge the impact that social media has on the formation of an individual's social skills. This README contains selections of information from the paper written as part of this project. The full paper can be accessed under <a href="https://github.com/shouldworkright/gen-case-study/blob/master/docs/Intergenerational%20Social%20Skills%20and%20Social%20Media%20Usage%20(Report).pdf">docs/Intergenerational Social Skills and Social Media Usage (Report).pdf</a>.

## Abstract

The purpose of this case study was to determine if social media usage at an early age has an influence on the formation of certain social skills. We created three sets of social skills questions and sent them to a focus group of 32 participants over the course of 2 weeks, with 8 individuals representative of the following generational brackets: Baby Boomer (53+ yrs. old), Gen X (36-52 yrs. old), Millennial (23-35 yrs. old), and Gen Z (18-22 yrs. old). Questions were developed to determine an individual's likelihood to exhibit a particular social skill. 6 social skills were analyzed: "directness", "empathy", "meaningful discussion", "precise communication", "idiom comprehension", and "cultural literacy". Each social skills was placed into one of 2 categories. These categories were “Physical Social Skills”; social skills most applicable to in-person interaction (directness, empathy, meaningful discussion), and “Internet Social Skills”; skills most applicable to online communications (precise communication, idiom comprehension, cultural literacy).

Our findings suggest that Baby Boomers are more confrontational and direct than all other generations studied, and are severely inept in Internet Social Skills. Our data also suggests that Gen X are adept in empathy, but also severely lacking in Internet Social Skills. Both Millennials and Gen Z are increasingly adept in expressing Internet Social Skills, with empathy remaining the highest Physical Social Skill between both generations. Thus, the data would indicate that early exposure to social media makes an individual more adept in expressing Internet Social Skills while producing no notable increase in for any Physical Social Skills.
